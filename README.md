# MyConcerts

A web application that finds upcoming concerts you would be interested in based on your Spotify data. If you do not link your spotify account, it will still show upcoming concerts. Allows you to sort by location, date, genre, and more. Implemented using Django, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, SQL, and multiple APIs including the Ticket Master, Spotify, and Youtube API. Created in a team of 5 following Agile procedures. 

Includes register/login utilities which encrypts your information, notifications to your email which can be toggled, a edit profile page, and more. Concerts are cleanly lined up with photos, information, price, and more. If you click on a certain concert, you can see more detailed information. This includes a link where you can buy the ticket, a youtube preview of the artist, and information given by the concert organizers such as parking/food information and concert policy. Each concert can be 'starred' which allows you to save concerts to your profile favorites. Supports accessibility for the color blind and those who are blind/cannot read.

I just moved this to my main github account from my school one.
